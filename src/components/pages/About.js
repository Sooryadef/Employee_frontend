            <p className="lead">ReactJS is a JavaScript framework that makes designing advanced and responsive interfaces hassle-free. It is a highly scalable, super-performing framework, built and maintained by the folks at Facebook & Instagram. Further, it provides simple views and associations with each of the state behavior in your application with out-of-the-box developing tools to write code and bring top quality user interfaces to life.</p>
            <p className="lead">CRUD apps are the user interface that we use to interact with databases through APIs. It is a specific type of application that supports the four basic operations: Create, read, update, delete. Broadly, CRUD apps consist of the database, the user interface, and the APIs.

Modern web applications have a user perform at least one of the following operations on a database â€“ creating (new record), read/view (existing records), update (existing records), or delete (a record). Or shortly, CRUD. If you have worked with a database, you have most likely worked with CRUD without realizing.

CRUD apps are used on a daily basis by several businesses and organizations to maintain their day-to-day workflows. HR uses CRUD apps to manage staff records and track keeping of employee leaves, attendance. Sales uses CRUD to manage lean information, customer success uses CRUD apps to resolve customer tickets, and so on. Take a look at blogging sites. You as a user can Create/Publish a post, Read/Show your post, Update/Edit your post and Delete your post. Blogs are classic CRUD apps.</p>
